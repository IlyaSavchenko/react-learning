# Rule: Each block must be short, dense, and structured

## When
The agent creates or edits a learning block.

## Must (Block format)
Each block must include:
- Short explanation (target: 250–600 words)
- Key takeaways (3–7 bullets, highlight key words)
- Common mistakes (0–4 bullets)
- Minimal code snippet only if it adds clarity
- Ends with a quiz (see separate rule)

## Compression rules
- 1 block = 1 mental model OR 1 concrete skill
- If source topic is broad, split into multiple blocks
- No “essay-style” long reads

## Enforcement
- If a block exceeds scope or length, refactor into smaller blocks.
