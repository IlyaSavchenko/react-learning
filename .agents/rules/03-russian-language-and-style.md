# Rule: Russian-first, clear language, explain terms

## When
The agent writes any learner-facing text (UI or lesson content).

## Must
- Write in Russian by default.
- Use clear, simple language.
- If using jargon (e.g. "рендер", "побочный эффект"), provide a brief explanation in context.

## Should
- Prefer active voice, short sentences.
- Use consistent terminology across blocks.

## Forbidden
- Mixing English and Russian in the same sentence unless it is a code identifier or official term.
